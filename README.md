# fuzzy1
This code demonstrates how to use fuzzification before decision making by taking two input variables, age and income, and using them to determine a credit score. The input variables are fuzzified using triangular membership functions, and the rules for determining the credit score are evaluated using the minimum operator. Finally, the credit score is defuzzified using the centroid method.

Note that this is just a simple example to demonstrate the concept of fuzzification before decision making, and there are many other techniques and approaches that can be used in more complex scenarios.
